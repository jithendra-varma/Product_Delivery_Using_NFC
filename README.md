# Product Delivery Using NFC

Intelligent Delivery System uses a whole new system to abruptly change the existing delivery system whether it be with respect to e-commerce or products from retailers. This delivery system took all the flaws of the traditional delivery system and solved them to make the existing delivery system a more sustainable one. To reuse the packaging as economically as possible. So this intelligent delivery system works on the three main principles to solve the traditional problem.

- Using reusable packaging for shipping the products.
- Making the packaging easy to deliver.
- Making the products to be returnable with a customer loyalty rewards program.

## Using reusable packaging for shipping the products

Reusable packaging is packaging that is used multiple times, often for the purpose of transporting products. It is typically designed for durability, ease of use, ease of cleaning, and ease of repair and is ideally collapsible or nestable. All of those characteristics make it easy to return to the original user, which can utilize it over and over again. For small businesses, reusable packaging may consist of industrial-size containers, such as drums, or smaller, consumer-size packages, such as kegs or plastic bottles. For consumers, reusable packaging can be opportunistic in nature, such as reutilizing cardboard boxes, water jugs, or glass bottles.

Traditional e-commerce packaging uses single-layer cardboard boxes. It is a box made with one layer of corrugated cardboard. Single-walled boxes are often used in e-commerce shipping as they are lighter and cheaper than double-walled boxes. But it also makes it non-reusable as they get damaged due to the delivery process. So, we are aiming to use triple-walled boxes and other alternatives which can be reused for product delivery. The following are the top alternatives for traditional packaging.

1. Using paper bubble wraps.
1. Using Paper tapes.
1. Using Corn-starch Packaging.
1. Biodegradable foam chips (Packaging Peanuts).
1. Using sustainable and recycled plastics.

These alternatives are biodegradable alternatives to traditional packaging delivery systems. But we are trying to implement a more strong, more durable and cost-effective alternative for traditional packaging using recycled plastics packaging.

## Making the packaging ease to deliver

The traditional packaging delivery uses paper receipts, invoices, labels to store the information of the products details, contact information, payment information, and the delivery address. These receipts are also made from paper which might possess an environmental threat because to make these receipts alone we are cutting many trees. This is one of the major problem posed by the traditional delivery system. Also there is an security threat of information by third person who has hands on the package because he might try to steal the information which might be confidential and personal to the customer. This open access to information about the packaging can be a major security threat in the day today usage of e-commerce platforms to order some personal products for usage.

Also the traditional packaging delivery system lacks the ease of delivery to deliver the products. Normally to deliver the products the delivery person needs to search his catalogue for the details of the product along with the customer details this is a time consuming process. let us take the case of a delivery person who needs to deliver a toothbrush which is ordered by the customer through an e-commerce platform. To deliver this toothbrush the delivery person has to check his catalogue for the customer details who ordered the product. This makes the delivery process  more complicated.

To address all the above-addressed issues we are adding NFC tags to the packaging boxes. These NFC tags can store information.

1. Instead of papers which are non-reusable we can use NFC tags as storage for receipts which are reusable.
2. NFC tags are more secure than paper receipts because they can be encoded to be opened by specific customers and delivery persons thus solving the issue of security threats.
3. NFC tags can also make the delivery process very easy. We can add the details so that the delivery person can just tap his mobile on the NFC tag on the box to get all the details of the product including the contact, and payment information thus making the delivery process easy.

## Making the product returnable using a customer loyalty rewards program. 

In the normal delivery system if the idea of reusing a product is to be implemented then we have to answer the specific question of the customer that is 

“Why should I return the package?”

So to answer this question we created a customer loyalty program. By definition, a customer loyalty program is a marketing approach that recognizes and rewards customers who purchase or engage with a brand on a recurring basis. A company may give points or perks, and graduate customers to higher levels of loyalty the more they buy. These incentives and specific benefits often result in the customer becoming a more regular consumer or the ideal — a brand promoter. Benefits may involve free merchandise, rewards, coupons, or insider perks like early access to new products. 

A customer loyalty program is what drives the customers to return the packaging. Such that if the customer returns the product he will be awarded some perks i.e., points. These points can be redeemed for brand vouchers or some other exciting deals. Such that both the customer and e-commerce platform can be benefitted from this program. Customers is benefited from the rewards obtained from the program. The E-Commerce platform is benefitted by reducing the usage of new packaging materials.

# **Implementation**

There are three faces of implementation in the system.

2. [Programing specific tasks for each NFC.](https://github.com/jithendra-varma/Intelligent_Delivery_System/blob/main/2.Product_Delivery_Using_NFC/Programming_specific_tasks_for_NFC.md)
