# **Selecting the packaging material**

The packaging material selected should be reusable. Reusable packaging is manufactured of durable materials and is specifically designed for multiple trips and extended life. A reusable package or container is designed for reuse without impairment of its protective function. The term returnable is sometimes used interchangeably but it can also include returning packages or components for other than reuse: recycling, disposal, incineration, etc. Typically, the materials used to make returnable packaging include steel, wood, polypropylene sheets or other plastic materials. Reusability of packaging is an important consideration of the environmental credo of “reduce, reuse, and recycle”. It is also important to the movement toward more sustainable packaging.

So bio-pp is a bio alternative of polypropylene. Bio-based polypropylene is a polymer manufactured from natural materials such as corn, sugar cane, vegetable oil, and some other biomass. The properties of bio-based polypropylene are similar to synthetic polypropylene. This polymer is used in injection moulding, textiles, film, and other applications.

Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.

Polypropylene belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially crystalline and non-polar. Its properties are similar to polyethylene, but it is slightly harder and more heat resistant. It is a white, mechanically rugged material and has a high chemical resistance. Polypropylene is the second-most widely produced commodity plastic (after polyethylene). In 2019, the global market for polypropylene was worth $126.03 billion. Revenues are expected to exceed US$145 billion by 2019. The sales of this material are forecast to grow at a rate of 5.8% per year until 2021.
